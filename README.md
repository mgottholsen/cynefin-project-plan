# Project Cynefin
Cynefin is a Welsh word meaning haunt, habitat, acquainted, accustomed, familiar. It carries with it a sense of rootednessâ€”temporal, physical, cultural or spiritual. The word is similar in meaning to Heimat in German and has been compared to the Maori word turangawaewae, a place to stand. The idea of the Cynefin framework is that it offers decision-makers a "sense of place" from which to view their perceptions.

## Brief
The goal of this project is to utilize, analyze and store multiple streams of raster & vector location related data, to create a multi-modal remote sensing platform for Louisville Metro Government.

## Immediate Enterprise Use Cases
There are any number of use cases for leveraging image-related data within a governmental body. This Innovation Project not only leverages existing or low cost commodity hardware for remote sensing & data collection, it also proves that low cost and intelligent smart city technology is in the reach of most cities.
